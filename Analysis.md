Lets look at the correlation between each of the variables in the data frame. We can generate the correlation in a tabular format and as well as the same thing we can use a heat map to understand the correlations pictorially

Lets build a distribution plot, which depicts the bar chart of which car in what price ranges are sold the most. If you see the chart below you see that most of the cars sold are in the price range from 5K to 25K

Now lets perform a box plot analysis on various numeric columns to understand what the outliers are. How should we manage those outliers?

If we look at price then we notice that most of the price variants fall in between 8k to 28K range and few of the extreme outliers are above 40K in price.

If we look at the wheel base we notice that majority of the case wheel base falls in between 95 and 113. The outlier here is with one falling in the 121 range.

In the existing data lets look at some graph visualization of various categories such as engine location, number of cylinders the car has, drive wheel, bodystyle, number of doors etc. This is one aspect of data mining where one tries to understand the characteristics of the data in your data set.

So if you see some basic mining excercises, most of the cars that are sold are with front engines. There is a significant amount of cars that are sold which are two door, which almost constitue around 80%+ of the total sales compared to four door sedans. The most popular body style cars are sedan and hatchback.
